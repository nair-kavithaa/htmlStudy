		&quotHTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages.
		HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML&nbsp4.01&nbspversion is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012&quot.
